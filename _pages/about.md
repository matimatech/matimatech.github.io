Hi, I’m a final-year Mathematics student @ [UINAM](https://uin-alauddin.ac.id) with a strong passion for data, technology, and problem-solving.

With a solid foundation in mathematical thinking and hands-on experience in Data Science @ [Pacmann Academy](https://pacmann.io/), I enjoy transforming complex problems into structured, data-driven solutions. I’m comfortable working with statistical models, machine learning concepts, and turning raw data into actionable insights.

My background in mathematics trained me to think logically and rigorously, while my interest in technology pushes me to build practical and scalable solutions through code. I’m highly curious, detail-oriented, and always eager to learn new tools and approaches.

Currently, I’m looking for opportunities where I can grow as a data professional, contribute to impactful projects, and continuously sharpen both my analytical and technical skills.
